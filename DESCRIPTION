Description: The ITR.forest package facilitates the construction of a large
    interaction tree using IPWE or AIPWE estimation of the reward function.
    The functions available allow the user to simulate data from either an RCT or
    observational study, build a large interaction tree, find important interaction
    variables, and calculate the variable importance measures for all variables included
    in the tree construction. Currently, only continuous outcomes are
    allowed in the construction of the tree.  Both continuous and categorical covariates may 
    be entered as potential splitting variables.
