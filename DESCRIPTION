Description: The ITR.Tree package facilitates the construction of a large
    interaction tree using the value function ITR tree method developed by Doubleday, Zhou, and Fu.
    The functions available allow the user to simulate data from either an RCT or
    observational study, build a large interaction tree, generate a random forest, find important interaction
    variables, and plot the variable importance measures for all variables included
    in the tree construction. Currently, only continuous baseline variables are
    allowed in the construction of the tree.
