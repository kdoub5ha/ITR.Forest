Description: The ITR.Tree package facilitates the construction of a large
    interaction tree using the value function ITR tree method developed by Doubleday, Zhou, and Fu.
    The functions available allow the user to build a large ITR interaction tree, perform cross validated pruning to obtain an optimally sized subtree, generate a random forest, and estimate variable importance measures. Users can simulate data from RCT or EMR study designs for purposes of exploring the functions available.
